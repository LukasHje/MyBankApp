> This is a simpel (but fun) project I did during work-innovation week.
> <br />Even though i work mainly with Pl/SQL and databases im happy with how much i managed to accomplish in a mere week. 
> <br />It's a ATM / Investment estimation application. the functionality replicates real life ATM's and banking investment growth websites
> <br />All code and GUI is created by me, myself and I. As you more experianced developers and grapich designers probably can tell.. :)
